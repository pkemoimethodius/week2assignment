# A SHOPPING LIST
the aim of the project is to create an interactive shopping list that allows the user to add and remove items from the list as they wish.

## INSTRUCTIONS
To launch it you need to open the index.html on a web page.
The javascript code will only load after the page is fully loaded due to a feature I included.
The shopping list is easy to use as there are labelled buttons that allow for simple operations.

## CONCLUSION
combination of frontend skills opens a multiverse of opportunities,the simple list just harnesses some of the features.
Happy coding!
